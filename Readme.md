# Office Mapper

This is a tool in order for office managers to manage where each person's sitting. After the initial creation of the map, and recording seating locations, the manager can easily update the list and the changes will be automatically updated onto the map.

Feature:
- Hover over seat to see Name, extension, etc (depending on what information is needed)
- Download list of user information
- Export selected information and arrange by selected column (example: Export name + extension and sort by name)
- Search for individual by name, ext, or any of the personal information in list
- Export and print a map of the office with first names on the map itself (for printing purposes)
